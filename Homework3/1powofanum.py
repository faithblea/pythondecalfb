x=5
y=3 
# intitalizing varbiables 

for i in range (x): 
    #establishing the for loop to have a range of x amount of numbers 
    y *= y 
    # exponent factor of y 
    print(y)
    # print the function 

# this code was inspired by some reading that I did on quora, here is the website that I used: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-a-number-an-exponent-of-another-in-Python-without-using-the-inbuilt-%E2%80%98**%E2%80%99-or-the-%E2%80%98math-pow%E2%80%99
